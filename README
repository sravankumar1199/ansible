Ansible is heterogenous
#### its runs all flovours like ubuntu,centos,fedora...automative change the command based on flavour #

Ansible can scale or configar at a time
### its configur server at a time ######

Ansible take care of validation and echo statement to users
##### its doesn't need validation...####

Ansible is easy syntax compare to shell script


PUSH Architecture 
### ansible server push configar to node ###

PULL Architecture
### first node push configur to chef server then chef server pull configur to node ###
### in chef server nodes every 30 mins nodes downloads the configar from chef server ###

ansible is configuration managament tool
## installing packages
## installing programmming languages
## installing buildtools
## creation of users,folders etc
## setting permissions

PULL
## nodes should connect to the servers through agent software.

PUSH
## THERE IS NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD AGENT INSTALLATION
## servers push configur to the nodes directly
## ansible use ssh authentication to connect to the server
## ansible server connects node through ssh
